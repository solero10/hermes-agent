# Hermes Agent Testing Guide

This file holds the full testing guidance that used to live in the root
`AGENTS.md`. The root file keeps only short commands and invariant rules.

## Development Environment

```bash
# Prefer .venv; fall back to venv if that's what your checkout has.
source .venv/bin/activate   # or: source venv/bin/activate
```

`scripts/run_tests.sh` probes `.venv` first, then `venv`, then
`$HOME/.hermes/hermes-agent/venv` (for worktrees that share a venv with the
main checkout).

## Testing

### Python
**ALWAYS use `scripts/run_tests.sh`** — do not call `pytest` directly for repo
verification. The script enforces hermetic environment parity with CI
(credential vars unset, TZ=UTC, LANG=C.UTF-8, PYTHONHASHSEED=0) and runs each
test file in a freshly-spawned subprocess through `scripts/run_tests_parallel.py`
(no xdist, no shared workers). Direct `pytest` on a 16+ core developer
machine with API keys set diverges from CI in ways that have caused multiple
"works locally, fails in CI" incidents (and the reverse).

```bash
scripts/run_tests.sh                                  # full suite, CI-parity
scripts/run_tests.sh tests/gateway/                   # one directory
scripts/run_tests.sh tests/agent/test_foo.py -- -k test_x  # one test/filter
scripts/run_tests.sh -v --tb=long                     # pass-through pytest flags
```

**Flake policy:** the runner auto-retries a failing test FILE once in a fresh
subprocess (`--file-retries`, default 1; `HERMES_TEST_FILE_RETRIES=0` to
disable). Pass-on-retry counts as green but is printed in a `⚠ FLAKY` summary
section with both attempts' output. A FLAKY report is a bug to fix, not noise
to ignore — timing-sensitive tests must not assume a quiet runner (loose
wall-clock bounds ≥ 2s, event-based sync, no `assert not _wait_until(...)`
negative-timing races).

#### Subprocess-per-test-file isolation

Every test file runs with per-file subprocess isolation: a freshly-spawned Python subprocess via `run_tests_parallel.py`. This means module-level dicts/sets and
ContextVars from one test file cannot leak into the next.

#### Why the wrapper

|                     | Without wrapper                             | With wrapper                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Provider API keys   | Whatever is in your env (auto-detects pool) | All env vars except a specific few unset. |
| HOME / `~/.hermes/` | Your real config+auth.json                  | Temp dir per test                         |
| Timezone            | Local TZ (PDT etc.)                         | UTC                                       |
| Locale              | Whatever is set                             | C.UTF-8                                   |

### Where to place what tests

The CI change classifier (`scripts/ci/classify_changes.py`) runs specific jobs based on what files changed. A Python test that asserts
about the contents of `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `.ts`/`.tsx`
source, or any other JS-side artifact will not run on a PR that only touches
those files. This means a regression can go green on a PR and red on `main` (where the
classifier fails open and runs everything).

Any test that reads or asserts about `package.json`,
`package-lock.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.js`/`.mjs`/`.cjs`
source files configuration belongs in the JS (vitest) test suite, not in `tests/*.py`.

### Don't write change-detector tests

A test is a **change-detector** if it fails whenever data that is **expected
to change** gets updated — model catalogs, config version numbers,
enumeration counts, hardcoded lists of provider models. These tests add no
behavioral coverage; they just guarantee that routine source updates break
CI and cost engineering time to "fix."

**Do not write:**

```python
# catalog snapshot — breaks every model release
assert "gemini-2.5-pro" in _PROVIDER_MODELS["gemini"]
assert "MiniMax-M2.7" in models

# config version literal — breaks every schema bump
assert DEFAULT_CONFIG["_config_version"] == 21

# enumeration count — breaks every time a skill/provider is added
assert len(_PROVIDER_MODELS["huggingface"]) == 8
```

**Do write:**

```python
# behavior: does the catalog plumbing work at all?
assert "gemini" in _PROVIDER_MODELS
assert len(_PROVIDER_MODELS["gemini"]) >= 1

# behavior: does migration bump the user's version to current latest?
assert raw["_config_version"] == DEFAULT_CONFIG["_config_version"]

# invariant: no plan-only model leaks into the legacy list
assert not (set(moonshot_models) & coding_plan_only_models)

# invariant: every model in the catalog has a context-length entry
for m in _PROVIDER_MODELS["huggingface"]:
    assert m.lower() in DEFAULT_CONTEXT_LENGTHS_LOWER
```

The rule: if the test reads like a snapshot of current data, delete it. If
it reads like a contract about how two pieces of data must relate, keep it.
When a PR adds a new provider/model and you want a test, make the test
assert the relationship (e.g. "catalog entries all have context lengths"),
not the specific names.

Reviewers should reject new change-detector tests; authors should convert
them into invariants before re-requesting review.

### Never read source code in tests

A test that reads a source file's text is testing *the shape of the
source code*, not its behavior. This is a hard antipattern, banned outright.
Any test that reads a .py, .ts, .tsx, etc., file is suspect.

**Why it's actively harmful, not just weak:**

- It passes when the implementation is subtly broken (the regex matches a
  call site that exists but is wired wrong) and fails when a correct
  refactor changes formatting, variable names, or control flow with
  identical runtime behavior. Both directions of failure are wrong.
- It can't be run against a built/bundled/minified artifact, so it silently
  stops testing anything the moment code moves, gets renamed, or a
  dependency reformats it.
- It actively blocks refactors: reviewers see "keeps a pattern intact" tests
  fail during pure structural cleanup with no behavior change, and either
  hand-wave the failure (dangerous) or waste time updating regexes that add
  nothing (waste).
- It gives false confidence. a green suite full of source-regex tests
  looks like coverage but has never once executed the code path it claims
  to guard.

**Do not write:**

```ts
const source = fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'main.ts'), 'utf8')

test('backend spawn hides the Windows console', () => {
  assert.match(source, /spawn\(\s*backend\.command,\s*backend\.args[\s\S]{0,300}hiddenWindowsChildOptions/)
})
```

**Do write — extract the logic into a small pure/DI-testable function and
call it for real:**

```ts
// backend-spawn.ts
export function hiddenWindowsChildOptions(options: SpawnOptionsLike = {}, isWindows = process.platform === 'win32') {
  if (!isWindows || 'windowsHide' in options) return options
  return { ...options, windowsHide: true }
}

// backend-spawn.test.ts
test('windowsHide defaults to true on Windows, is left alone elsewhere', () => {
  assert.equal(hiddenWindowsChildOptions({}, true).windowsHide, true)
  assert.equal(hiddenWindowsChildOptions({}, false).windowsHide, undefined)
  assert.equal(hiddenWindowsChildOptions({ windowsHide: false }, true).windowsHide, false)
})
```

If the logic lives inline in a god-file (`main.ts`, `cli.py`,
`gateway/run.py`) and extracting it feels disruptive: that's the actual
signal to do the extraction, not to regex around it.

## Runner Argument Notes

Anything after a literal `--` is passed through to each per-file pytest
invocation. Bare pytest flags such as `-q`, `-v`, `-k pattern`, and `--tb=long`
also pass through automatically. Positional test targets before `--` should be
directories or `.py` files; for a single test, name the file and pass `-- -k
pattern`.
